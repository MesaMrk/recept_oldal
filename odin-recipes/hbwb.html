    <h4>Ingredients</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>1 (.25 ounce) package active dry yeast</li>
        <li>1 ¾ cups warm milk (110 degrees F/45 degrees C)</li>
        <li>1 egg yolk</li>
        <li>2 eggs</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons white sugar</li>
        <li>2 teaspoons salt</li>
        <li>5 cups all-purpose flour</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon poppy seeds</li>
        <li>1 egg, beaten</li> 
    </ul>
    <h4>Instructions</h4>
    <ol>
        <li>In a small mixing bowl, dissolve yeast in warm milk. Let stand until creamy, about 15 minutes.</li>
        <br>
        <li>Mix the egg, egg yolks, sugar, and salt.
            In a large mixing bowl, combine the yeast mixture with the egg, egg yolks, sugar, salt and 3 cups of the flour; stir until well combined.
            Add the remaining flour, 1/2 cup at a time, stirring well after each addition.
            When the dough has pulled together, turn it out onto a lightly floured surface and knead until smooth and supple, about 8 minutes.</li>
        <br>
        <li>Turn out onto a floured bread board, and cut into 2 equal parts. Form into cylindrical loaves; let rest for 20 minutes.
            Divide each loaf in half and roll into a long rope for braiding.
            Fasten the 4 ends together. Braid. End by fastening the ends, and turning each end under the loaf.
            Place on cookie sheet, and cover with a towel until doubled in size, about 40 minutes.</li>
        <br>
        <li>Brush risen loaf with a beaten egg and sprinkle with poppy seeds.
            Bake at 400 degrees F (200 degrees C) for 15 minutes. Reduce heat to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C) and bake for an additional 45 minutes, or until golden brown.</li>
    </ol>
